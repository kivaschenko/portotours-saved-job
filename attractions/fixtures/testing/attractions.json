This place is perfect for an exciting family visit, and will certainly appeal not only to children but also to all adults who are not indifferent to the beauty and uniqueness of the underwater world. Lisbon Oceanarium is unique because it contains the inhabitants of all oceans without exception in one place. There is also a second building connected to the main one by a transparent gallery. The place is open not only to conduct excursions here but also to carry out serious scientific research on underwater flora and fauna.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the ground floor, there are 25 aquariums where you can view marine inhabitants individually. And in the center of the second floor, there is a huge tank about seven meters deep. Even though the representatives of different climatic zones are separated by a transparent partition, it is almost imperceptible, which emphasizes the idea of the unity of the waters of the World Ocean. This floor is also occupied by four thematic aquariums - in each of them is recreated the flora and fauna of one of the oceans. The second building is educational, as it hosts exhibitions, events, and excursions dedicated to the protection and safety of species.</p>",
        "introduction_text_below_slider": "<p>The huge sunfish is the main attraction of the Oceanarium since its maintenance requires strict conditions. Also in the Lisbon Oceanarium lives a giant Pacific octopus weighing about 250 kg and with a tentacle span of 9 meters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The collection includes endangered species such as seahorses, octopuses, manta rays, and mobulas. The entire population is strictly protected by a research team that cares about the health and living conditions of the inhabitants. In the outdoor pools, you can meet vices and parrots, penguins, and otters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main focus of the activities held here are organized excursions, but the base also regularly hosts master classes, exhibitions, concerts, and shows. The main purpose of most exhibitions is scientific and social activities, within which one can learn about endangered species of animals and the impact of human activities on the ecology of the seas. Some events are purely entertaining. In addition, it is possible to organize events upon individual request.</p>",

        "introduction_text_above_slider": "<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">The Castle of St. George is the heart of the Portuguese capital, the history of which began at the turn of two eras. In 1147, it was liberated by the Crusaders from the Moors. Afonso Henriques, the commander of the Crusaders, became the first ruler of the country. Then, until the 16th century, the castle was the official royal residence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">Outstanding architecture and history made the castle one of the symbols of the country, a great introduction to medieval history for tourists. The complex is memorable for its calm atmosphere and solemnity, perfect for the Lisbon city walking tour. It mesmerizes with gorgeous panoramic views of Lisbon with red-tiled roofs and the Tagus River. As for the collection of cannons and an archaeological museum, it&#39;s more than impressive.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">From the top of the hill, there are open views of the ancient part of the city and houses with tiled roofs. The monument to the first king Afonso, who holds a shield and sword in his hands, is also located here. The castle went through numerous buildings and changed many times, the last time it was restored in the 20th century.</span></p>",
        "introduction_text_below_slider": "<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">The fortress is presented not just by one castle, but by an ancient town, a popular destination for day tours from Lisbon. Visitors can see preserved fragments of medieval battlements, walking through the inner parks of olive trees of this magnificent landmark of Portugal. When Vasco da Gama returned from sea voyages, the celebration was here, as well as various significant events for the kingdom. The towers are open for visitors, so everyone has the opportunity to climb and take a walk along the fortress walls.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">For a more interactive experience, it&#39;s recommended to pay attention to the numerous multimedia exhibitions, held here every day. The Castle of St. George in Lisbon suffered badly from an earthquake in the 16th and 18th centuries. However, the fortress walls have been restored and are in good condition. In the Tower of Odysseus, for example, you can see panoramas of Lisbon, and an archaeological museum is located in one of the old wings of the fortress. Projected images on the walls show the major city&#39;s historical events, such as a simulated earthquake, the return of Vasco da Gama, the fall of the Church of Carmo, and much more, from the era of the Inquisition to the period of the Salazar dictatorship.</span></p>",
