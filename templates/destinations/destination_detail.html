            What to See in Lisbon
        </h2>
        <p class="what-to-see-subtitle body-text-b2">
            Lisbon, the capital of Portugal, is one of the most vibrant and charismatic cities in Western Europe.
        </p>
        <p class="what-to-see-text body-text-b3">
            Lisbon is a perfect blend of elegant palaces, luxurious squares, majestic cathedrals, historical museums, and monuments with narrow cozy pretty streets and neat houses decorated with traditional Portuguese Azulejo tiles. You can start your walk around the city from the Ribeira market, where you can try delicacies from all over the country at once. Continue to Commerce Square and then explore the Lisbon Cathedral.
        </p>
        <p class="what-to-see-text body-text-b3">
            Climb a little higher, walk to the archaeological museum and the Carmo Convent, and from there go to the Santa Justa elevator with a panoramic view at the top.
        </p>
        <p class="what-to-see-text body-text-b3">
            In the center, you can take the old tram 28, get off at the very top of the Basilica of Estrela, and explore it and the cozy park next door. Then get to the Castle of St. George, and explore its towers and fortress walls, halls, and museums.
        </p>
        <p class="what-to-see-text body-text-b3">
            The number of sightseeing is incredible, many of them are on the UNESCO list, so a professional guide to the main places is the best solution to dive into the culture.
