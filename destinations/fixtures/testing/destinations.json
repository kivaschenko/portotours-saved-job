How to Make the first trip to Lisbon unforgettable?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Admire the city from the observation deck. The view of Lisbon from above is impressive and enchanting. All the beauties of the city appear before the viewer: the Tagus River, ships sailing along it, the ocean, bridges, churches, and houses. If you&#39;re out of time, the best option to see all the main sights and attractions of Lisbon is to choose a one-day tour in Lisbon. And don&#39;t forget to try Portuguese wines as Portugal is famous for its vineyards. Red and white wines from the region are distinguished by high taste qualities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. What is a list of hidden treasures of Lisbon?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&#39;re interested in non-tourist places, Lisbon is extremely rich in such locations. For the first adventure, pay attention to underground Roman galleries. One more place is Reservoir Mahe d&#39;Agua Amoreiras. The reservoir, which received the title of Queen of Water, was built to collect flows from the main Lisbon aqueduct. And if you have time, visit the National Museum of Costume and Fashion. This museum displays men&#39;s, women&#39;s, and children&#39;s clothing that was considered fashionable from the 17th to the mid-20th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. What dishes are the must-try in Lisbon?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What to eat in the city, located by the ocean? Of course, a variety of seafood dishes: baked octopus, sardines, shrimp, oysters, lobsters, mussels, and a variety of fish dishes. Don&rsquo;t forget about local Portuguese dish &ndash; the &ldquo;bacalhau&rdquo;, for example, Past&eacute;is de bacalhau (cod croquettes) or Bacalhau &agrave; bras (stewed cod with potatoes, onions, and eggs). This is a traditional Portuguese dish originally from Lisbon, which Senor Brush began cooking for the first time. The portions are large, so plan your strength wisely. And be sure to leave room for dessert!<br />\r\nAnd among desserts it should be pointed out that the famous Paste de Belem (or Pastel de Nata) cakes are the number one dessert in Portugal.</p>",
