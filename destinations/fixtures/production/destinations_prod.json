All the beauties of the city appear before the viewer: the Tagus River, ships sailing along it, the ocean, bridges, churches, and houses. If you&#39;re out of time, the best option to see all the main sights and attractions of Lisbon is to choose a one-day tour in Lisbon. And don&#39;t forget to try Portuguese wines as Portugal is famous for its vineyards. Red and white wines from the region are distinguished by high taste qualities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. What is a list of hidden treasures of Lisbon?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&#39;re interested in non-tourist places, Lisbon is extremely rich in such locations. For the first adventure, pay attention to underground Roman galleries. One more place is Reservoir Mahe d&#39;Agua Amoreiras. The reservoir, which received the title of Queen of Water, was built to collect flows from the main Lisbon aqueduct. And if you have time, visit the National Museum of Costume and Fashion. This museum displays men&#39;s, women&#39;s, and children&#39;s clothing that was considered fashionable from the 17th to the mid-20th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. What dishes are the must-try in Lisbon?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What to eat in the city, located by the ocean? Of course, a variety of seafood dishes: baked octopus, sardines, shrimp, oysters, lobsters, mussels, and a variety of fish dishes. Don&rsquo;t forget about local Portuguese dish &ndash; the &ldquo;bacalhau&rdquo;, for example, Past&eacute;is de bacalhau (cod croquettes) or Bacalhau &agrave; bras (stewed cod with potatoes, onions, and eggs). This is a traditional Portuguese dish originally from Lisbon, which Senor Brush began cooking for the first time. The portions are large, so plan your strength wisely. And be sure to leave room for dessert!<br />\r\nAnd among desserts it should be pointed out that the famous Paste de Belem (or Pastel de Nata) cakes are the number one dessert in Portugal.</p>",

        "introduction_text": "<p>The city of Porto is one of the largest in Portugal. It received the name Porto Calais in honor of the two Roman tribes Portus and Calais, which in ancient times lived on different banks of the Douro River. Despite the centuries-old rivalry with Lisbon, Porto is considered to be the real capital of Portugal in the north. The city is located on Pena Ventosa Hill near the Atlantic Ocean, boasting its beauty and an impressive number of attractions. The historical center of it has been preserved to this day in its original form. Since 1996, the city has been included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 11th century, the Arabs were expelled from here, and Porto became a strategic point of the region. It was also the largest port, maintaining connections with England, Flanders, and the cities of the Hanseatic League. The future Henry the Navigator was born here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The architecture of Porto is not as rich in palaces and cathedrals as Lisbon. At the same time, Porto tourist attractions are presented by monumental Baroque buildings, tiled churches, old factories, colorful roofs on gray stone buildings, trendy bars, informal shops, hidden picturesque streets, art venues, and contemporary art museums.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can start your walk around the city from Avenida dos Aliados, where mansions from the late 19th and early 20th centuries have been preserved. Also here you can visit a bright example of Porto historical architecture - the Gothic Church of S&atilde;o Francisco, dating back to the 12th century. The cathedral served as a defensive structure along with the city walls. Nowadays it&#39;s open for visitors, showing the exquisite interior, bright frescoes, and stained glass windows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Cl&eacute;rigos Tower is one of the symbols of Porto, and also the tallest in the country (75 m). Previously, it served as a landmark for merchant ships entering the port. Today everyone can go up to the observation deck with a beautiful view of the entire city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Ribeira area with its small colorful houses on the hill is also a must-see. It&rsquo;s good to walk along the narrow winding streets in any weather, enjoying the views and trying the cuisine in local cafes. And then you can make a trip on a ship or boat along the river with the colorful embankment of Cais de Ribeira.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Guimar&atilde;es Castle is one of the most impressive buildings not only in the area around Porto but in all of Portugal. 4 towers, several gates, and a wooden bridge have survived to this day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In your free time, take a stroll through the Porto Botanical Garden, the oldest in the country. It is divided into 3 parts: ponds with aquatic plants, flower beds, and greenhouses with tropical vegetation. Don&#39;t miss Porto art galleries and photography spots to make your experience of the city more complete.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the museums, it is worth highlighting the Tram Museum, the exhibits of which are preserved in excellent condition. One more great place for family weekends: Crystal Palace Park with numerous playgrounds and areas for leisure activities. The park is decorated with all kinds of sculptures and installations made in modern and antique styles. Sports competitions, concerts, and other interesting cultural events for children and adults are regularly held here. The main entertainment for small visitors is feeding the peacocks, which stroll imposingly right across the lawns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Modern Porto and its surroundings are developing dynamically. Nowadays it&#39;s one of the country&#39;s largest ports, and its residents are known for their patriotism and strive to emerge from the shadows of the capital&#39;s inhabitants.</p>",

        "introduction_text": "<p>Sintra is located near the capital of Portugal, east of the Sierra de Sintra mountains that separate it from the Bay of Biscay, being a perfect destination for day trips from Lisbon. Sintra is known for its numerous castles, parks and gardens, green vineyards, narrow streets, rich villas, and picturesque views of the sea and mountains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can start the Sintra sightseeing tour with a walk around the city center. Here is located one of the most famous attractions and its main symbol, Sintra Pena Palace. Built in the 19th century, the palace is not only a Sintra UNESCO World Heritage object but is also considered one of the Seven Wonders of Portugal. Sometimes it is even called Disneyland for adults as the building seems to have been copied from a collection of fairy tales! Thanks to the bright paintings, numerous turrets, courtyards, and elaborate romantic architecture, the building looks like a toy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next must-visit spots are the Pena Gardens and the summit of Cruz Alta. Here you can simply walk, admiring the numerous statues, decorative pools, and elegant gazebos. Additionally, it is worth visiting the top of the Cruz Alta hill in the southern part of the park. Here, at an altitude of 529 meters above sea level, is the highest point of Sintra, from where Lisbon can be seen in good weather.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A 20-minute walk from the Pena Gardens is the medieval Sintra Moorish Castle, which was founded in the 10th century. Its powerful towers, parapets, and battlements will delight any fans of history. However, even if the Middle Ages are not the focus of your interest, you will probably enjoy the breathtaking views of the surrounding area. Sintra lives its own life below, and far on the horizon are seen the waters of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Montserrat Manor is another famous object of Sintra cultural heritage and the second must-have palace in Sintra. The villa is decorated in a romantic style, attracting attention with the impeccable decoration of the interior rooms. No less charming is the luxurious park around the mansion with a lake in the middle, numerous springs, grottoes, and rare species of trees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is hardly a list of attractions that does not include Sintra Quinta da Regaleira. A huge mansion with a mystical 19th-century park in the Gothic style is rightfully considered the pearl of Sintra. The gardens of Quinta da Regaleira are full of symbolism and secret meanings, references to religion, alchemy, and Freemasonry. Quinta da Regaleira is full of unexpected finds and sudden discoveries. But undoubtedly the main attraction here is the Well of Dedication (Po&ccedil;o Inici&aacute;tico).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Well of Dedication is a spiral staircase that goes 27 meters deep. The staircase looks like a tower screwed into the ground and, thanks to this strange shape, is shrouded in many outlandish legends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have free time in Sintra and want to see it from another angle, pay attention to the shoreline as here is located the incredibly popular Agrada beach, famous for its waves and the sports competitions that constantly take place here (including world-class ones). Among others should be mentioned large Grande Beach, the most beautiful beach in Portugal, Baby Ursa, Praia das Masanches, and Magoito. If you take the opportunity to go surfing, fishing, and other water activities in the clear water of the Atlantic Ocean and on the golden sands of local beaches, then Sintra will be a paradise for travelers. No big surprise, that this city is considered the main tourist destination of the so-called Portuguese Riviera</p>",

It eventually became an important trading post for the Phoenicians and later an important Roman military outpost. It&rsquo;s hard to believe, but this tiny town, with two streets and a population of no more than ten thousand inhabitants, was once an impregnable fortress. After the Islamic period, in the 12th century, started the construction of one of the most famous Obidos tourist attractions, Obidos Castle. It was built by the Arabs and reconstructed by order of Alfonso Enriquez. The harsh fortress walls that surround it were built later, and most often served as protection against attacks by corsairs. Today, the castle is one of the seven most outstanding architectural monuments in Portugal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since King Dinis gave the city as a wedding gift to his wife Isabella, &Oacute;bidos belonged to Portuguese queens until the 19th century. Since then, Obidos historic town has been considered a city of weddings, and newlyweds are advised to visit it for good luck. Many come here and spend their honeymoon. This fact explains why so many architectural monuments, such as the Aqueduct, were built. The earthquake of 1755 and the Peninsular War in the early 19th century took their toll and led to renovations to the historic center, but &Oacute;bidos never lost its medieval urban charm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nowadays the city is a popular tourist destination, famous for its medieval market and the delicious Ginjinha cherry liqueur served in every bar in the city. You can easily explore &Oacute;bidos in one day, or stay overnight and see other nearby attractions such as Lagoa de &Oacute;bidos and Buddha Garden.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obidos historical architecture is characterized by a huge number of ancient cathedrals with magnificent chapels. The most popular from a tourist&#39;s point of view is the Cathedral of Santa Maria. The most ancient and still active in Obidos is the Cathedral of St. James, built at the beginning of the 12th century. Not far from it is the Church of St. John the Baptist, which attracts tourists with its unusually elegant Chapel of St. Martin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obidos is also home to a great religious spirit, expressed in its churches and shrines, which are emphasized by their scale and architecture. The main churches are Santa Maria and San Pedro, both of which have a royal atmosphere upon entry. The Church of the Misericordia, or the Church of Our Lady of Montserrat in Baroque style are also on the list of must-see Obidos attractions. The Chapel of S&atilde;o Martinho is an example of charming medieval and gothic mixes. Don&#39;t forget to visit the incredibly beautiful Temple of Senhor Jesus da Pedra, the perfect creation of Rodrigo Franco.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The largest fair takes place here, where you can buy Obidos souvenirs, made in the best traditions of Portuguese craftsmen. In addition, souvenirs and even antiques can be purchased in one of the shops on Rua Direita.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, on the list of Obidos things to do is the International Chocolate Festival, held annually, because several small confectionery factories are located on two streets of the town.

Nowadays, &Eacute;vora is an open-air museum where you can spend an interesting day, enjoying incredible views.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Historical sites in Evora Portugal have been considered a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1986, as most of the attractions, among which are 20 famous churches and monasteries, are concentrated here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The old town of &Eacute;vora looks like a labyrinth of narrow streets and traditionally painted houses with historical and cultural monuments, perfectly fit into the landscape. The city has a rich history and tours from Lisbon to Evora are the must-have to get a deep understanding of Portugal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The central Giraldo Square looks like a typical Portuguese plaza. Today there is a fountain on the square, from which go eight main streets. The fountain is the place where water from the Silver Water Aqueduct was first received. The square has many cafes that offer beautiful views of the local landscape. This is Evora&#39;s busiest place, with a relaxed atmosphere, but the real history is far from the idyllic picture. In the Middle Ages, this square was a central point for the cruel trials of the Inquisition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One more must-see attraction is the 13th-century Cathedral, whose architecture combines Romanesque and Gothic styles. The highlight of the Cathedral is its treasury, which is a museum of sacred art with rare and priceless artifacts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for Evora&#39;s most famous landmark, it is the Temple of Diana, built in the 2nd or 3rd century AD. It is represented by fourteen columns topped with Corinthian capitals, perfectly preserved to our days. The history of the temple is not so romantic as in the Middle Ages it was used as a gallows and later as a slaughterhouse. In the 19th century, the architectural monument was taken under protection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An amazing spot to visit is the 14th-century Palace of the Dukes of Cadaval with the remains of an ancient castle. The exhibition includes valuable manuscripts, ancient weapons, as well as paintings and sculptures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Church of St. John the Evangelist is a 15th-century building, a great example of architecture in the Gothic style. The church was built on the site of a Moorish castle and is part of the Cadaval Palace. Here you can fully enjoy the Azulejo art used in the rich decoration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Romantic church of St. Francis in the Gothic style definitely deserves attention. Previously, there was a Romanesque church, dating back to the 13th century. The unique feature of the church is an arcade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The top attraction for visitors here is the Bone Chapel Evora(Capela dos Ossos). It&#39;s rather small, but its gloomy interior, made of human bones, is unforgettable. The Chapel of Bones Evora was created in the 16th century with the remains of previously deceased people from the nearby cemetery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The building of the university, founded in the mid-16th century, is also a must-visit place. This university was rather popular among students and masters from all over Europe, but in the 18th century, it was closed and opened again only 200 years later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Enjoy your slow walking along the streets of Evora, where among other attractions should also be mentioned the monastery of St. Clare (15th century) with a temporary collection of the city museum. As the museum itself is under restoration, its most valuable exhibits are presented in the decorations of the monastery. Just within walking distance from this place is the city garden with a small outdoor cafe with delicious local cuisine, and the remains of Don Manuel&#39;s palace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&Eacute;vora is a very hospitable city with a rich history, where every walk is full of new impressions.</p>",

According to Peniche history, the first inhabitants here were the Lusitanians, who were hiding from Julius Caesar, settled on the peninsula, and founded a town here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Typical tourist program mostly includes seeing amazing views of the ocean and landscapes, slow walks through the historical center, and surfing. Fortress of St. John the Baptist is a must-visit historical attraction. In 1557, King Jo&atilde;o III built defensive walls with 4 meters thickness and a fortress to protect the city from pirate attacks from Africa. During the First World War, it served as a prison, later as a political prison, and as the City Museum since 1984. It exhibits the prison environment, archeology, and shipbuilding of those times. Additionally, there is an incredible panorama of the ocean.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The peninsula does not have many historical and cultural attractions. But Portuguese fishermen are religious, and look for a bright future in faith, and this fact explains the large number of churches in the area. The most significant temples are the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Healing and the Temple of St. Peter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanctuary of Our Lady of Healing (Santu&aacute;rio de Nossa Senhora dos Rem&eacute;dios) is a chapel in the rock, lined with unique tiles from the 18th century. It was built after a carved image of the Mother of God was found on the wall of one of the caves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The temple complex deserves the attention of visitors, being a favorite place of locals for walking. The protective walls and a courtyard with pine trees, located near Cabo Carvoeiro, open up picturesque views. The 30m high Cape Carvoeiro offers an overwhelming panoramic view of the ocean and cliffs. In 1790, a lighthouse (Farol do Cabo Carvoeiro) 27 meters high was built here.

It was built in the 16th century and is considered the largest in the area. The building contains a statue of St. Peter and paintings from his life. The main chapel in the Baroque style is covered with gilded carvings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the main associations with Peniche that comes to mind is surfing. For the past years, it has become an integral part of life here. However, the first recordings of foreign surfers date back to the mid-60s. Nowadays, Peniche is the main surfing region of Portugal and, despite its small size, the town is recognized as the real Portuguese surfing capital. In October, the ASP World Championship stage is held here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peniche beaches are numerous. Supertubos Beach is famous for its high tube-shaped waves and the right wind. The crests of the waves here are so long that a kind of corridor is formed between them and the bottom of the wave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A place for those who dream of learning to ride. Peniche surf schools of various levels are located here. The beach has been awarded the Blue Flag for its cleanliness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One more popular place is the Baleal spot. It has white sand, crystal clear water, and picturesque cliffs, and in the past whale bones were often found on the beach. Residents say that old whales came here to die, so it got the name &ldquo;Baleia&rdquo;, which means &ldquo;whale&rdquo; in Portuguese.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s highly advisable to take a long boat ride to the island of Berlengas (Ilha das Berlengas), which is a Nature Reserve. Its clear waters create ideal conditions for divers, who will find here a natural stronghold for marine fauna and flora. The rough sea and seclusion of the island have always provided a good basis for mysterious stories about fishermen and ships that have crashed off its shores.</p>",

One of the most beautiful sunsets on the Nazar&eacute; coast is here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fortress of S&atilde;o Miguel Arcanjo on a rocky cliff is the best place to view the giant waves in Praia do Norte. The building was originally created by King Sebastian in the 16th century to protect Nazare from foreign invaders. Nearby Nazar&eacute; is the monastery of Saint Mary of Cos, which dates back to 1670. The interior with a golden altar, tiled walls, and stunning painted ceilings is well-kept till our times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nazar&eacute;, Portugal, is a unique town, attractive for visiting at any time of the year.

No matter how you come to the Douro Valley, by boat cruise or by land, positive impressions along the way with an opportunity to visit vineyards and authentic villages and take part in the process, are guaranteed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Douro River cruises are extremely popular as they allow you to see the valley in all its pure beauty. In 2001, the Alto Douro wine region was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. The traditions of wine production here are unique, having deep roots, which didn&#39;t change much with the flow of time. The history of wine in Douro Valley goes back to ancient times. It&#39;s believed that wine has been produced using traditional methods, dating back to the Roman Empire, for two thousand years. What is even more surprising is that the process did not change during the Moorish conquest. Even though Muslims could not drink wine, it became a profitable business and was often used for trade and export.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alfonso Henriques, the first king of Portugal, and Cistercian monks from this region are believed to have made a significant contribution to the cultivation of grapes in Douro wine region.

It&#39;s Portugal&#39;s main export wine, but along with it, there are many other unique wines of this region. The history of l&#39;Alto Douro is the history of port wine. Here and there, among the terraces with red-tiled roofs, are located the vineyards. In autumn they make wine, which is sent to the cellars of Vila Nova de Gaia in the spring. The names of wineries are written in huge letters on the tops and slopes of Douro hills to make the trademarks visible from a considerable distance. It&#39;s one of the most unique symbols of Douro landscape. In general, there are more than 80 traditional varieties of grapes cultivated here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The list of Douro sightseeings is not limited only by natural wonders.

It lies at the base of a tiered granite staircase decorated with white and blue azulejo tiles. Nearly 700 steps lead to the Church of Our Lady of Remedies, a striking example of the Rococo style. Pinyan is also a great place to see traditional tiles. The building of the local station is lined with 25 panels depicting Douro Valley vineyards and picturesque surroundings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Douro Natural Park is located near the Spanish border. Here, relict juniper forests alternate with oak and olive groves. The valley here was turned into an archaeological park with an open-air gallery of rock paintings.

It stretches along the southern coast of the Alcabideche district. Although the fort was included in the list of objects of public importance back in 1977, it needs renovation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The small fort of San Teodosio, located along the coast in Estoril, on Poza Beach, was built during the reign of King Jo&atilde;o IV.&nbsp; The fort served as a defensive line between San Julian da Barra and Cabo da Roca.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Cascais Citadel, used as a summer residence for the President, was built around 1488 by King John II. In its garden is located a small open-air artillery museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Palace Museum of the Counts of Castro Guimar&atilde;es is located in the ancient port city of Cascais, where fishing flourished in ancient times.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, it attracts tourists with its endless beaches, international events, and the pleasant warm atmosphere of a resort town.</p>",

Every year on the 13th, from May till October, hundreds of thousands of pilgrims come here to celebrate the anniversary of the unforgettable apparitions of the Virgin Mary, begging for her intercession for all of humanity. This event is the greatest revelation since her ascension to Heaven. The Catholic Church recognized the Fatima apparitions as the most important message of the Mother of God to the modern world, and a true miracle. The construction of the Basilica, the main pilgrimage point, started at the beginning of the last century. Here are the relics of all three kids who saw the Virgin Mary: Lucia, Jacinta, and Francisco.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fatima sanctuary visit is undoubtedly interesting not only for hundreds of believers but also for non-religious people. This is a large building with a huge square where believers gather at certain times which architectural value can&#39;t be denied. This sanctuary is a construction formed by the Chapel of the Apparitions in the place where the Virgin Mary appeared to the shepherds. At key points of the phenomena throughout the city can be found the statues, proving it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Basilica is carried out in neo-Baroque style. Its construction on the spot where the small shepherds saw the Virgin Mary began several decades after the apparitions when the place became a spot of worship and pilgrimage. It has a central tower, topped with a bronze crown, and a famous sequence of colonnades beautifully decorated with ceramic panels depicting the Stations of the Cross. The Chapel of the Apparitions was at first a small building, but today it is a small modern chapel with an image of the Virgin Mary on the site of the tree in which she appeared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Basilica of the Holy Trinity is considered one of the largest in the world in terms of total internal area, more than 10 thousand square meters. THE construction began in 2004, and the opening took place 90 years after the significant event. It has 5 chapels, about 50 confessionals, and a cafe where believers can relax. The interior space is decorated with a mosaic of hand-made tiles, depicting Heavenly Jerusalem. In addition, quotes from the Bible in 23 languages are painted on the walls. The building is low so that it would not block the view of the Basilica of Fatima. There are 13 doors to get inside the Church of the Holy Trinity, according to the number of those present at the Last Supper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for other attractions, the ethnographic house-museum of Aljustrel definitely deserves attention. It is located in a small village, on the very outskirts of the city of Fatima, but it&#39;s still an important object for Fatima religious tourism. Here were born the children who met the Virgin Mary for the first time in 1917. The museum is a small house with various exhibits related to the &ldquo;Miracle of Fatima&rdquo;, as well as other artifacts of those times. On the walls, you can see many paintings depicting the life of the village before and after the appearance of the Virgin Mary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those tourists who are not too religious will enjoy the wax museum. The museum has two parts, thematically divided for visitors. The first one presents scenes of the appearance of the Virgin Mary to children, as for the other, it would be interesting for all categories of visitors, as it shows famous personalities of the city.

Legend says that the hill was shown to them in a mystical vision. Upon arrival in Tomar, it is impossible not to see this amazing monument surrounded by lush trees.

Tomar is home to one of the most beautiful and mysterious castles in Portugal. It has existed for hundreds of years and became the last stronghold of the Templars in Europe when persecution began against them. Tomar is also famous for its Renaissance wall paintings. Perhaps, this is the only place in the country where there are examples of such a high class. All this against the backdrop of the leisurely life of the old town.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Tomar travel guide mentions that the Holy Grail is kept here, but there is no official evidence of this fact. The majestic monastery, built in the mid-12th century, although at first it was a castle and not a Catholic monastery, looks more like a powerful fortification.

Tomar resident Aquiles de Mota Lima started to collect matches in 1953. This happened during his trip to London for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.
